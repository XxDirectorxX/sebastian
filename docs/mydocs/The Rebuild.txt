Project Overview: The goal of the Sebastian AI project is to create SOTA qauantum AIS 
assistant that is sophisticated and capable of understanding and performing tasks 
with a personality modeled after Sebastian from Black Butler and functionality similar
to Jarvis. Sebastian is intended to run across multiple platforms (Windows, Android, 
and possibly embedded devices), utilizing Python for AI and machine learning, C# for 
Windows-based desktop applications, and py for Android.

Best Language for Sebastian AI:
Primary Language: Pythons py 

AI & Machine Learning: 
py robust libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) support deep learning, NLP, and AI 
functionalities that are essential for Sebastian. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and OpenAI’s GPT ensure 
robust conversational capabilities.

Voice Recognition: 
Python’s SpeechRecognition, pyaudio, and DeepSpeech allow seamless voice interaction.

Automation & API Integration: 
Libraries like requests, selenium, and pyautogui facilitate task automation and 
integration with APIs for emails, calls, etc.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
Python runs on Windows, Linux, and Android (via Kivy, PyQt, or Flask for mobile apps).

Scalability: Python’s support for microservices, cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud), 
and edge AI allows for future growth of Sebastian's features.

Ease of Development: Python offers quick prototyping, debugging, and extensive 
community support.

Other Languages for Specific Tasks:
C++: Real-time processing for audio/video (if required).

Rust: For backend performance and security.

JavaScript (Node.js): If there’s a web-based interface.

Kotlin/Swift: If building native Android or iOS apps

Objective: Build a SOTA qauantum AIS assistant named Sebastian. this Sota quantum 
AIS will exceed Jarvis's functions and capabilities but have the voice and personality
of Sebastian Michealis from black butler english dub. Using py as the primary 
language. Ensure cross-platform compatibility for desktop, mobile, and backend 
communication.

Core Features for Sebastian:
AI & Machine Learning:

Use py-based libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras for deep learning.
Implement NLP capabilities using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, OpenAI’s GPT.
Integrate speech recognition with libraries such as SpeechRecognition, pyaudio, 
and DeepSpeech.

Utilize py (or python if required) for automation (e.g., handling emails, calls, web interactions).
Optimize for mobile compatibility with py and backend via Flask or FastAPI.

Voice Interaction:

Integrate speech recognition and voice synthesis for seamless voice-based interactions.
Optionally include voice cloning for a personalized and unique experience (model based on Sebastian’s character).
Personality & Emotional Intelligence:

Develop Sebastian’s emotional and Social intelligence to respond based on user sentiments.
Build personality modules to emulate the Sebastian-like persona (polite, intelligent, witty).
Include behavioral systems to allow dynamic adjustments based on user interaction.

Backend & Data:
Use py for the core AI/ML models, data processing, and decision-making.
Implement API integration (Flask/FastAPI) for frontend-backend communication.
Include training and inference scripts for model handling (speech, NLP, etc.).

Task Automation & Interaction:
Enable Sebastian to automate tasks (schedule appointments, manage reminders, etc.).
Ensure conversation management for chatbot interactions, using Python-based NLP models.
Implement user profile management to track preferences, tasks, and emotional responses.

Platform Compatibility:
Support Windows (via C# frontend) and Android (via py).
Ensure communication between the Python backend and C# frontend using REST APIs or gRPC.
Optimize the backend for scalability, allowing for cloud services or edge AI integration as needed.
Intelligence System:

Develop decision-making algorithms and modules to make autonomous decisions.
Organize AI functionalities into key components:
AI, Brain, Butler, Persona Categories: each category will house its respective files. 
For example:

AI contains files focused on decision-making algorithms, learning logic, etc.
Brain has memory management files, knowledge base files, and learning algorithms.
Butler contains routines, task scheduling, assistant tone, and smart home automation.
Persona holds files for the emotional and social aspects of Sebastian, such as humor, 
loyalty, and empathy.

Model Folder: 
All the models for NLP, speech recognition, and core AI will be in the models folder. 
This includes files for defining, training, and using each model.

object_recognition: 
Optional vision-based tasks (face, object detection).

AI/ML Tasks in py: 
AI models and speech/NLP processing should remain in Python for flexibility and use 
of powerful libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and NLTK.

Cross-Platform Support: Ensure proper integration with C# for desktop (Windows) 
and py for mobile (Android) to maintain a seamless user experience across platforms.

Voice Integration: 
Both speech recognition and voice synthesis must be handled with Python libraries, 
with C# potentially integrating them for desktop UIs.

Personality & Customization: 
Emulate a Sebastian-like personality by managing the AI's

emotional intelligence, conversational skills, and behavioral dynamics within the 
Intelligence-Systems folder.
