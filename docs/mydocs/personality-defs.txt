AI, Brain, Butler, Persona Categories: As mentioned before, each category will house its respective files. For example:

AI contains files focused on decision-making algorithms, learning logic, etc.
Brain has memory management files, knowledge base files, and learning algorithms.
Butler contains routines, task scheduling, assistant tone, and smart home automation.
Persona holds files for the emotional and social aspects of Sebastian, such as humor, loyalty, and empathy.
Model Folder: All the models for NLP, speech recognition, and core AI will be in the models folder. This includes files for defining, training, and using each model.

Data Folder: Data storage (both raw and processed) will be managed here. This includes personality-related data, training data, validation data, and other input/output-related files.

Config Folder: Configuration files will store settings for various systems in Sebastian, including personality settings, interaction rules, or device-specific configurations.

Tests Folder: Each category will have associated tests, such as personality tests, behavior tests, and interaction tests, helping ensure each feature works as intended.

Benefits of This Structure:
File Distribution: The categories and sub-categories provide a logical way to break up and organize your 337 files. This prevents any category from becoming overwhelming.
Separation of Concerns: It separates your personality, models, and utility functions, making it easier to navigate and update parts of the system.
Scalability: As your project grows and the number of files increases, this structure will keep everything manageable and prevent files from becoming too cluttered or hard to find.
Key Considerations:
Subdivide Even Further: You might want to further subdivide larger folders (like brain or butler) into even more specialized subdirectories to keep things as organized as possible.
Naming Convention: Consistent naming conventions will help immensely when you have this many files. Use clear, descriptive names for each file to avoid confusion later.
Modularization: As your project grows, modularizing the components will become crucial to prevent dependency problems and to ensure smooth updates and maintenance.
