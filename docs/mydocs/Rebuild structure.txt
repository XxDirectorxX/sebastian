intelligence_system

ai/: 
This folder contains the files for AI tasks such as speech recognition, task management, and executing actions based on AI functions.

brain/: 
It holds the cognitive processes of Sebastian, such as memory management, decision-making, and learning algorithms.

butler/: 
This is dedicated to Sebastian's service-oriented tasks, including scheduling, task planning, and executing assistant actions.

persona/: 
This folder is where you define Sebastian's character traits, emotional and social intelligence, such as his personality, empathy, and communication style.

task_management/: 
Modules related to task handling, scheduling, and execution.

emotional_intelligence/: 
Modules for recognizing and simulating emotions, and performing sentiment analysis.

user_interaction/: 
Modules for conversation management, generating responses, and user profile management.

learning_system/: 
Modules for adaptive learning, model updates, and processing user feedback.

object_recognition/: 
For vision-based capabilities (like object or face recognition), if you decide to integrate them.

If you're adding robotics control, like movement or obstacle detection.

autonomous_actions/: 
For decision-making logic and autonomous execution of tasks.

Intelligence-Systems 
has been expanded to include Behavioral Systems, Customization/Scalability, and Voice Cloning with dedicated subdirectories and relevant scripts for each.
Voice Cloning is added as a separate subdirectory for handling voice synthesis and voice model cloning.
Behavioral Systems is added to manage dynamic action reactions, sentiment analysis, and adjustments based on user behavior.
Customization now includes systems to manage user preferences and profile customization, scaling features to accommodate new users or expanded functionalities.

Task Management and Scheduling: 
This setup adds a robust task management system, which is essential for advanced autonomous task execution.

Emotional Intelligence: 
Incorporating emotion recognition and sentiment analysis allows for more sophisticated user interactions.

Learning Systems: 
This supports continuous improvement of the AI based on user feedback and adaptive algorithms.

Object and Robotics Control: 
Potential to add computer vision and robotics integration, which could significantly expand Sebastian's capabilities.

Multi-Platform Frontend: 
The inclusion of both desktop (Windows) and mobile (Android) platforms makes Sebastian more versatile, enabling it to work on various devices.
Comprehensive Testing: Having unit tests, API tests, and integration tests ensures reliability and scalability.
